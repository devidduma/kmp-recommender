# kmp-recommender
A prototype recommender of websites using Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.

Knuth-Morris-Pratt is an important online string searching algorithm published jointly by Donald E. Knuth, James H. Morris Jr. and Vaughan R. Pratt in 1977. I am presenting a use case of Knuth-Morris-Pratt at the heart of a simple, keyword based recommender system. Refer to [abstract.pdf](abstract.pdf) for more details.
